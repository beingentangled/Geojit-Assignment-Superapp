# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

# Flutter SuperApp Architecture

Welcome to the revolutionary **Flutter SuperApp Architecture** - a cutting-edge modular framework that redefines how cross-platform applications are built, scaled, and maintained.

## What is a SuperApp?

A SuperApp is a comprehensive platform that integrates multiple services and functionalities within a single application. Think of WeChat, Grab, or Gojek - these apps started as single-purpose applications but evolved into ecosystems that serve multiple needs.

Our Flutter SuperApp Architecture takes this concept and provides a **technical foundation** that makes building such applications not just possible, but **elegant, scalable, and maintainable**.

## Why This Architecture is Advanced

### ðŸš€ **Unprecedented Modularity**
Unlike traditional Flutter apps or React Native solutions, our architecture treats each feature as a completely **independent module** with its own lifecycle, dependencies, and deployment cycle.

### ðŸ”§ **True Separation of Concerns**
Each module can be:
- Developed by different teams
- Tested independently
- Deployed separately
- Versioned independently
- Updated without affecting other modules

### ðŸŽ¯ **Enterprise-Grade Scalability**
Built to handle applications with:
- 50+ feature modules
- Multiple development teams
- Complex business logic
- Real-time updates
- Micro-frontend patterns

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the architecture template
git clone https://github.com/beingentangled/Geojit-Assignment-Superapp.git
cd flutter-superapp

# Install dependencies
melos bootstrap

# Run the superapp
flutter run
```

## Architecture Highlights

- **Module Contracts**: Type-safe interfaces between modules
- **Dynamic Routing**: Automatic route registration and navigation
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Update modules without app restart
- **Micro-Package Management**: Independent module dependencies
- **Enterprise Integration**: Built for CI/CD and DevOps workflows

## Next Steps

2. [Creating Your First Module](./modules/creating-modules.md) - Build a feature module
3. [Deployment Guide](./deployment/firebase.md) - Deploy to production

*This architecture represents the future of cross-platform development - where modularity meets performance, and scalability meets developer experience.*
